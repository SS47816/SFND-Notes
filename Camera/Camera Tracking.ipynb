    "#### Locating Keypoints in an Image\n",
    "As discussed in the previous lesson, a camera is not able to measure distance to an object directly. However, for our collision avoidance system, we can compute time-to-collision based on relative distance ratios on the image sensor instead. To do so, we need a set of locations on the image plane which can serve as stable anchors to compute relative distances between them. This section discussed how to locate such anchor locations - or keypoints in an image.\n",

    "Take a look at the three patches in the following figure which have been extracted from an image of a highway driving scene. The grid shows the borders of individual pixels. How would you describe meaningful locations within those patches that could be used as keypoints?"
