% Range Doppler Map Generation.

% The output of the 2D FFT is an image that has reponse in the range and

% to range and doppler based on their Max values.

%design a loop such that it slides the CUT across range doppler map by
%giving margins at the edges for Training and Guard Cells.
%For every iteration sum the signal level within all the training
%cells. To sum convert the value from logarithmic to linear using db2pow
%function. Average the summed values for all of the training
%cells used. After averaging convert it back to logarithimic using pow2db.

%signal under CUT with this threshold. If the CUT level > threshold assign
%it a value of 1, else equate it to 0.
